\section{\large Projects}
{\bf Compressed Sensing Using Deep Image Prior and Learned Regularization}\hfill January 2018- \\
{\sl UT Austin, with D. Van Veen, Prof. Eric Price, Prof. Sriram Viswanathan, Prof. A.G. Dimakis}
\begin{itemize}\itemsep -2pt
	\item We show that deep convolutional networks are good priors for solving differentiable compressed sensing problems.
	\item We propose a new form of regularization that improves performance.
\end{itemize}

{\bf The Robust Manifold Defense: Adv. Training Using Gen. Models}\hfill May 2017- Present\\
{\sl UT Austin, with Andrew Ilyas, Eirini Asteri, Prof. A.G. Dimakis, and Prof. C. Daskalakis}
\begin{itemize}\itemsep -2pt
	\item By adding imperceptible noise to a clean image, an adversary can arbitrarily influence the prediction of a neural network on the image. We show that generative models can defend against adversarial attacks.
	\item We search for an image in the span of a generative model that is close to an input image- this helps filter out adversarial perturbations. We also demonstrate how this idea can be used to robustify a classifier during its training.
\end{itemize}

{\bf Compressed Sensing Using Generative Models}\hfill August 2016- Present\\
{\sl UT Austin, with Ashish Bora, Prof. Alexandros G. Dimakis, and Prof. Eric Price}
\begin{itemize}\itemsep -2pt
	\item Introduced a new approach to compressed sensing. Traditional compressed sensing tries to find a sparse solution to an under-determined system of linear equations.
	\item Our approach is to search for an approximate solution in the span of a generative model.
	\item Proved upper bounds on number of measurements required for recovering a solution with low $\ell_2$ error. Empirical results show that we require $10$x less measurements than the traditional LASSO algorithm.
\end{itemize}

{\bf The Adwords Problem with Strict Capacity Constraints} \hfill May 2015- May 2016\\
{\sl TIFR, with Prof. Rahul Vaze and Prof. Umang Bhaskar}
\begin{itemize}\itemsep -2pt
	\item An adversary produces weighted jobs to a set of servers with finite capacities at discrete	time steps, and a matching must be found at each time step. Objective is to maximize the aggregate sum of jobs matched.
	\item Designed and proved approximation guarantees for randomised and deterministic online algorithms. Also showed that a load balancing algorithm is near-optimal for a special case.
	\item Proved lower bounds which show our algorithms are almost tight.
\end{itemize}

\begin{comment}
{\bf Text Dependent Automatic Speaker Recognition} \hfill Summer 2014\\
{\sl Audience Communication Systems, with Murali Deshpande and Vinay N Krishnan}
\begin{itemize}\itemsep -2pt
\item Implemented an adaptive Gaussian Mixture Model which can be trained to recognise a particular
keyphrase by a 	user. Can be used as part of a voice activated wake up feature for
cellphones.
\item Model uses approximately 10 seconds of training data per user and achieves 80\%+ accuracy.
\end{itemize}
